# betting-bot/config/leagues.py

# LEAGUE_CONFIG stores detailed settings for each league key.
# The keys (e.g., "NFL", "EPL") are what the user might select or what your bot uses internally.
# 'name' is the display name.
# 'id' is TheSportsDB league ID (can be None if not applicable or for manual entry leagues).
# 'sport_type' helps group similar sports (e.g., "Team Sport", "Individual Player", "Racing").
# 'participant_label' is what you call the main entity (Team, Player, Driver, etc.).
# 'team_placeholder' is an example for that entity.
# 'line_placeholder_game' is for game/match-level bets.
# 'line_placeholder_player' is for player-specific props (if applicable).
